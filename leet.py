28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/description/

Given two strings needle and haystack,
return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack,
or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.



Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.


Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
